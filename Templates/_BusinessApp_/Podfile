# PS: Made couple direct changes inside TWMessageBarManager, therefore be port these changes if will decide to upgrade this library:
# 1) please note there were issues with TWMessageBarManager on iPad and we applied suggested fix directly: https://github.com/terryworona/TWMessageBarManager/issues/59  However then made pod to stick with this conrete version. However it was fixed and now it should work, because I wrote and it was merged: https://github.com/terryworona/TWMessageBarManager/commit/581a116f5759f66f191218a99d669fb4db9678c3  Therefore you can put "pod 'TWMessageBarManager', '~> 1.7'" and reinstall again which will remove unnecessary static fix
# 2) also added icon adjustement. Search for "// Gytenis 07.05.15: icon's width and height will be adjusted according image"
