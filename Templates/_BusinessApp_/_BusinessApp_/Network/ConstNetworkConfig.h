/* Description:
    
    There is only one backend API url which is hardcoded within the app - app config request which is performed by ConfigNetworkOperation. App performs initial call upon launching and when returning from the background. This requests returns all backend app configs including all the backend API urls for all of the 3 environments (production, stage and development).

    Backend environment is determined during runtime reading a value from BackendAPIEnvironmentType key from main plist file
